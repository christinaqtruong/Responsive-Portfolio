      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="../Bootstrap-Portfolio/Christina Headshot.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Christina">

      <p>Born in the city of Round
          Rock, I studied at the University of Texas where I attained a B.S in Microbiology and a B.S in
          Medical Laboratory Science.
          I completed my clinical rotations in the DFW area, where I got my first job as a ASCP-certified
          MLS at Parkland Memorial Hospital. After working
          in the Chemistry department for about a year, I moved to Austin and began working nights as a
          generalist for Baylor Scott & White Medical Center in Pflugerville.
          As a generalist I ran the entire laboratory alone at night, covering the chemistry, blood bank,
          urinalysis, immunology, body fluids, and hematology departments. Currently
          I have started delving into web development as the next step in my career, with a future goal of
          entering the world of computer science as a software developer, where I hope
          to do work relevant to both the technological and medical industries.</p>
